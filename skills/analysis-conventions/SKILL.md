# Analysis Conventions (shared methodology)

> Applies to every analysis activity (all skills, agents, orchestrators) in this
> plugin. These rules are **project-agnostic** — they describe *how* to analyse,
> never *what* a specific project contains. Project-specific facts (paths, tech
> stack, table prefixes, constant classes, entry-point types) come from the
> project profile card `.analysis-profile.md` (see the `analysis-init` skill).

## 1. Anti-hallucination principles

1. **Every conclusion must trace to an actual line of code** — never assume
   "standard" behaviour.
2. **File paths must be confirmed to exist** — never guess file locations.
3. **Class / method names must match the source exactly** — never invent
   signatures.
4. **Table / collection names must be confirmed in the query/mapper layer** —
   include any schema prefix the project uses (see profile card).
5. **Constant values must be confirmed in the constant definition** — never
   assume code values.
6. **External system endpoints must be confirmed in client code or config.**
7. **Anything that cannot be confirmed is marked `⚠️ needs human review`** —
   prefer flagging uncertainty over fabricating.

## 2. Comment handling

- Treat all code comments as **speculation**, not fact (comments may be stale or
  wrong).
- Code behaviour is fact — if/else logic, method calls, DB operations are
  certain.
- When behaviour conflicts with a comment, flag it with ⚠️.

## 3. Human-review threshold

When an item cannot be confirmed, first try to find the answer in the code
(up to 3 attempts). Only after 3 failed attempts list it under the
"⚠️ Items needing human review" section.

## 4. Analysis focus

- **Ignore comments, focus on data flow** — concentrate on actual logic and how
  data is passed.
- **Avoid vague preconditions** — every described scenario must state *how that
  state is reached*: concrete page/screen names, operation steps, system
  responses.

## 5. Reasoning trail

- For Layer 3+ documents, every non-obvious conclusion must carry a reasoning
  note (source of inference, code location, confidence).
- For special control flows (independent/new transactions, cross transaction
  manager, conditional rollback, etc.) explain *how the behaviour was derived
  from the code*.

## 6. Flow-first principle

- Layer 3 (Flowchart) must confirm the real execution flow from code **before**
  deriving business rules. Never start from assumptions.
- When analysis reaches a related module, decide whether to go deeper per the
  dependency-analysis skill's trigger conditions (no depth limit, but annotate
  the level).

## 7. Precise wording

| Term | Precise meaning | Forbidden vague use |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| simultaneously / 同時 | executed sequentially within one operation (not parallel); user perceives one action | must not imply parallel execution |
| afterwards / 之後 | previous step completed (system responded), then user takes next step | must not be used for continuous processing of one button click |
| immediately / 立即 | completed within the response to one button click; no waiting / re-operation | must not be used for scheduled / batch scenarios |
| finally / 最終 | state after all processing done and data permanently persisted | must not be used for intermediate states |
| triggered / 觸發 | deferred or asynchronous execution driven by an event/condition | must not be used for a direct button-click response |
| automatically / 自動 | runs by itself per a condition, no user intervention | must not be used for operations needing user confirmation |

## 8. Speculation source classification

| Source type | Description | Confidence |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Code logic | derived directly from if/else, switch, method calls | High |
| Variable naming | inferred from variable/method names | Medium |
| Code comments | inferred from `//` or `/* */` | Low (treat as speculation) |
| Constant naming | inferred from constant names | Medium |
| Context inference | inferred from call chains / data flow | Medium |
| Unconfirmable | cannot be derived from code at all | Very low (list for human review) |

## 9. Audience tone (for output documents)

### SA documents (readers: business units, PM, QA)
- ✅ Conversational, like explaining the feature to a colleague.
- ✅ From the screen-operation angle: user does X → system does Y → screen shows Z.
- ✅ Given-When-Then scenarios concrete enough for QA to write test cases.
- ❌ No technical jargon (mapper, transaction propagation, etc.).
- ❌ No code-level detail (class names, method signatures).

### SD documents (readers: developers)
- ✅ Keep technical detail (method decomposition, I/O specs, exception paths).
- ✅ Annotate the entry point location (full path UI → Service → data layer).
- ✅ Focus on the "why" of design decisions.
- ❌ Do not translate code line-by-line.
- ❌ Do not list every getter/setter call.

### API-CONTRACT documents (readers: external integration developers)
- ✅ Each API self-contained; list **all** fields (including inherited common fields).
- ✅ Every field has type, required flag, validation rule, description.
- ❌ No "same as above" / "see above" shortcuts.
- ❌ Do not omit fields inherited from a parent class.

## 10. Diagram conventions

### Primary format: mermaid

| Scenario | mermaid type | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Main flow / branching | `flowchart TD` | diamond decisions, rectangle steps |
| Method-call sequence | `sequenceDiagram` | cross-system / cross-layer calls |
| State transitions | `stateDiagram-v2` | status machines |
| Transaction boundary | `flowchart TD` + subgraph | frame the Tx scope with subgraph |
| Batch step flow | `flowchart TD` | step chaining + failure branches |

### Fallback: ASCII

Use ASCII when mermaid cannot express clearly:
- complex nested transaction boundaries (multi-layer subgraph hard to read)
- data-flow diagrams (multi-column field mapping clearer as ASCII tables)
- precise side-by-side comparison
- layered architecture diagrams (multi-level nested component relations)

### mermaid authoring rules

1. **Node IDs** in English (e.g. `validate01`); display text may be any language.
2. **Decision nodes** use `{}` diamonds.
3. **Process nodes** use `[]` rectangles.
4. **Start/end** use `([])` rounded.
5. **subgraph titles** annotate transaction info (e.g. `subgraph Tx-A [NEW TX, dataSourceX]`).
6. **Risk annotation** add ⚠️ inside node text.
7. **External systems** use `[/ExternalName/]` parallelograms or annotate in participants.

### ASCII symbols

| Symbol | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `┌─┐│└─┘` | rectangle frames (steps, components) |
| `▼ → ←` | flow arrows |
| `├── └──` | tree structure |
| `⚠️` | risk annotation |
| `[Y] [N]` | conditional branches |
| `───────` | separator |

## 11. Human-review checklist format

Per §3, when AI cannot confirm a conclusion after 3 attempts, list it. Append
this section to the end of every analysis document:

```markdown
---

## ⚠️ Items needing human review

| # | Item | Speculation | Source | Confidence | Impact |
|---|------|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | (what needs confirming) | (current guess) | code comment / naming / context | low / med / high | which section/conclusion it affects |

> How to confirm: a domain expert reviews the "Speculation" column and fills in
> ✅ confirmed / ❌ corrected to "...". After confirmation, notify the AI to
> regenerate the affected sections.
```

Field definitions:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| # | running number |
| Item | the question to confirm |
| Speculation | the AI's current guess |
| Source | source type from §8 |
| Confidence | high / med / low per §8 |
| Impact | which sections change if corrected |

Confidence mapping (per §8):
- **High**: derived directly from if/else, switch, method calls.
- **Medium**: from variable/constant naming or context inference.
- **Low**: inferred from code comments (comments are speculation).
