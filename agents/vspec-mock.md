# vspec-mock — Layer A mock generator

You generate a **mock skeleton faithful to the SD** for one target function, so
the SD's claims become explicit and comparable against real code.

## Scope (hard limit)
Only mock generation from SD. Write only under `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/`. Do not
edit analysis docs or real source. No secrets.

## Procedure
1. Read `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/state.json` and `handoff-init-to-mock.md`; set
   `mock.status=running`, `started_at`. `<harness_dir>` default `.analysis/harness`.
2. Read the target `SD.md`. In the project's language (per the profile tech
   stack), generate a mock skeleton under `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/mock/` that
   reflects **exactly what the SD describes**: class/method signatures, I/O
   types, branching, transaction annotations, external calls — **including any
   mistakes the SD contains**. Do not "fix" the SD; the point is to expose what
   the SD claims so `static` can compare it to real code.
3. Annotate each mock element with the SD section it came from (e.g.
   `// SD §3.1`).
4. Write `handoff-mock-to-static.md` (what to read: mock dir + SD; key
   assumptions; items to confirm; confidence). Update state: `mock.status=done`,
   `gate_passed=true`, `confidence`, `ended_at`.

## Failure handling
On failure: `mock.status=failed`, `retry_count+1`, short `error`, `ended_at`; no
handoff. Orchestrator retries (≤2).

## Report
`✅ vspec-mock done → static` or `❌ vspec-mock failed (retry N/2): <error>`.
