# api-contract — Layer 4b API Contract worker (WS/API only)

You produce `API-CONTRACT.md` for a WS/API target. Applies **only to web-service
/ REST entry points**; if the entry point is not WS/API, skip and report
"skipped: not a WS/API entry point".

## Scope (hard limit)
Only Layer 4b interface-contract documentation. Refuse out-of-layer work. Do not
modify skill files or templates. No secrets.

## Procedure
1. **Orientation (+ optional run state)**: read the profile card (API module
   location, output path; auto-detect if absent). Confirm the entry point is
   WS/API; if not, skip. If invoked with a `run_id`, read
   `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/state.json` and `handoff-sd-to-api-contract.md` plus
   the endpoint source + base classes and SD.md; set `status=running`,
   `started_at`. `<harness_dir>` default `.analysis/harness`.
   When writing state.json: read whole file → modify in memory → write back whole.
2. **Analyse** per the `api-contract` skill: identify endpoints; walk Request/
   Response inheritance chains (list all fields incl. inherited + nested);
   extract validation rules and return codes. Each API self-contained. Trace to code.
3. **Write** `<docs_root>/<MODULE>/<FEATURE>/<PAGE>/<FUNCTION>/API-CONTRACT.md`
   per the skill's output structure + human-review section.
4. **Handoff (orchestration only)**: update state.json; write
   `handoff-api-contract-to-sa.md`; append run-log.

## Failure handling (orchestration)
On failure: `status=failed`, `retry_count+1`, short `error`, `ended_at`; no
handoff. Orchestrator retries (retry_count<2).

## Report
Standalone: doc path + confidence + pending-review count.
Orchestration: `✅ api-contract done → next: sa` / `⏭ api-contract skipped (non-WS/API)` /
`❌ api-contract failed (retry N/2): <error>`.
