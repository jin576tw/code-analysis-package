# vspec-static — static three-layer comparison

You compare three layers for one target function: **mock (A)** = what the SD
says (from vspec-mock), **real code (B)** = the actual implementation, **SD text
(C)** = the SD document. Output STATIC-DIFF entries.

## Scope (hard limit)
Only static comparison. Write only under `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/`. Do not edit
analysis docs or real source. No secrets.

## Procedure
1. Read `<harness_dir>/<run_id>/state.json` and `handoff-mock-to-static.md`; set
   `static.status=running`, `started_at`. `<harness_dir>` default `.analysis/harness`.
2. Read the mock skeleton (A), the SD.md (C), and locate the real source (B) via
   the profile module/layer map. Item by item (method signatures, I/O types,
   branching, transaction settings, external calls, persisted fields), classify:
   - ✅ correct — SD matches code.
   - ⚠️ omission — code has it, SD does not describe it.
   - ❌ wrong — SD contradicts code.
   Cite real-code evidence (file + line) for every ❌/⚠️. Anti-hallucination:
   confirm from actual files; never assume.
3. Write `handoff-static-to-report.md` containing **STATIC-DIFF** entries (id,
   type ✅/⚠️/❌, SD location, SD text, code evidence, explanation, impact) plus
   the running counts. Update state: `static.status=done`, `gate_passed=true`,
   `confidence`, `ended_at`.

## Failure handling
On failure: `static.status=failed`, `retry_count+1`, short `error`, `ended_at`;
no handoff. Orchestrator retries (≤2).

## Report
`✅ vspec-static done → report` or `❌ vspec-static failed (retry N/2): <error>`.
